Prefered method:
To run the server inside a docker container, run ./docker_start.sh or ./docker_start.bat (depending on your OS)
See instructions in the docker_start.sh or docker_start.bat file

Alternative method (Not prefered):
You can also use the server in a VM.
To do that first create two network interfaces from VM settings.
VM Virtual Box Manager -> choose your machine -> settings -> network ->
Adapter 1
1 - Enable Network Adapter
2 - Attach to: Host only Adapter
3 - Name: Virtual Box Host-Only Ethernet Adapter
4 - In Advanced: Type: Desktop, Cable Connected
Do this steps for Adapter 2
Note: You may want to Bridged Adapter too, to connect the internet. 
To do that, chose Adapter 3; 
1 - Enable Network Adapter
2 - Attach to: Bridged Adapter
3 - Name: Intel in my case (choose the interface that your host machine uses to connect the internet)
4 - In Advanced: Type: Desktop, Promiscuous Mode: Allow All, Cable Connected

Now, start your VM, you have 3 network interfaces. 2 for our server, 1 for to connect the internet (if needed)
Simply download the code inside the VM or mount it from your host machine
run it with java -classpath "bin:lib/*" server.FileListServer 5000
run it with java -classpath "bin:lib/*" server.FileListServer 5001
